## Independent/Group Exercise (1hr)

Documentation!

I'm going to share a link to a repo with the source code of this basic CRUD application.

I'd like you to document this application as robustly as possible using three types of issues:

```
- [documentation]
- [syntax question]
- [process question]
```

You're going to open issues on the repo formatting the title with the name of the file, the line you're starting from and ending at, and a small description of what you're describing.

```
  Issue Example 1: [documentation] server.js, lines 33-35, app.listen + callback
  Issue Example 2: [documentation] views/edit.hbs, line 2, form action w/ method override

  Issue Example 3: [syntax question] views/index.hbs, line 6, {{#each todos}}

  Issue Example 4: [process question] views/edit.hbs, lines 2,5,9, how to pass data to the view?
```

It might be a multi-line function or maybe just what a piece of middleware is doing, or several different lines about configuring the Express Router, etc.

You also might open issues on lines of code that you don't understand. Your fellow students or I will respond.

At the end of this exercise, we should have most if not all of this application documented with one if not more explanations of what each piece is doing.

This repo can then be used as a resource!

*(NOT AS A PLACE TO COPY + PASTE FROM)*
